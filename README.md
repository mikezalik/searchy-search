# Searchy-Search

[SEARCHY-SEARCH](https://searchysearch.herokuapp.com/) is a Ruby on Rails web app designed to help organize information and make it accessible for sales people on demand. Users can sign up, search pdf's, sales language and email templates as needed.

## Usage üë©‚Äçüíª

In order to get started with this app, clone this repo. Bundle install the necessary gems, assure postgresql is installed on your local device and you'll need to createdb searchy_search_development. Your terminal should look like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikezalik/searchy-search.git
cd searchy-search
bundle install
createdb searchy_search_development
rake db:migrate
```

- **Development**: to run the app locally you will need 1 terminal window/tab and a local postgresql instance (I prefer to use postgres.app to track my local dev instances). Open your browser to `localhost:3000` after you start the server with the command below.

```bash
rails s
```

- **Build/Production**: The app is hosted on heroku and can be accessed at (https://searchysearch.herokuapp.com/). Follow the steps below to deploy your own instance on heroku.

```bash
heroku login
heroku create
git config --list --local | grep heroku
git push heroku main
heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku open
```

## Project Summary

Searchy-search is a monolith designed to help keep important sales information close and retrievable. The primary focus is to keep this information indexable and easy to search for access while on sales calls or while typing up follow up emails for prospective clients. The secondary focus is to help maintain consistency within sales departments to help each sales executive find relevant and effective sales language.

## Design Process üìê

In the design phase of this application, I started thinking about user stories to determine key features. The primary user features are searching items and accessing these items. I decided to streamline authentication and use Devise to help with this. I approached this application from the standpoint of ease of use. I love React but reasoned that this same simplicity didn't warrant coupling React to a Rails backend and decided to use the ERB templating engine to provide the interface. The intent of the app was to make sure that accessing pertinent information was as straightforward as possible.

## Development Process üõ†

In the development phase of this application, I began with an MVC and RESTful build out in Rails. Though I prefer to work html first as it promotes progressive enhancement, I was concerned with the backend logic initially and the conventions in Rails allow for this approach to be used. With this base and a functional MVP, it was easy to choose which features would benefit from enhancement and which tools would be best suited for their creation. In order to maintain the goals set in my design process (with accessibility in mind), I used Embedded Ruby templates. Because I wouldn't need to reason with a lot of state within the app I thought this would be sufficient to help maintain simplicity and a straightforward implementation.

Styling is written in Sass and transpiled to CSS3.
